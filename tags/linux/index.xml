configured - through files. Using text for configuration might seem as a
step-back, however, GUI configurations were never a progression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having applications configured through text has a couple of advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Portable - any computer which can install that application can have the same
configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The light level of configuration - some Linux distributions, such as NixOS, offer
a system level configuration. However, this would invalidate the first point,
and the level of configuration would be potentially limited through the
configuration of the distribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>stow&lt;/code> method is minimal and re-uses packaging software for dotfiles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="your-dotfiles-in-git">Your dotfiles in Git&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to have portable dotfiles, you need a method of update &amp;amp; transport. For
that, you can use Git.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Minimal Linux Display Manager</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/a-minimal-linux-display-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 07:03:14 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/a-minimal-linux-display-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is this itch that tiling window manager users feel. Whether it is caused
by surfing the world of r/unix or the want for change, it might be useful to
have a way to easily switch between window managers. This article shows how to
achieve this using already installed applications on your system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>True Full Disk Encryption On Linux</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/true-full-disk-encryption/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 07:09:31 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/true-full-disk-encryption/</guid><description>&lt;p>My friends laugh at me when they are told that I have to put in 4 passwords
with ~18 characters each to login into my computer. I laugh back at them,
wishing them joy with Ads in the start-menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we will discuss &lt;em>true&lt;/em> full disk encryption. Everything,
including having the kernel encrypted using LUKS. I personally found difficulty
in finding good documentation detailing how to set-up disk encryption.
Hopefully this guide would help someone out there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
