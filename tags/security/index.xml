&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-quote" data-lang="quote">One shall secure his network stack, or shall suffer network leaks.
- a wise internet enjoyer
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Due to ArchLinux&amp;rsquo;s design of customizability and Laissez-Faire-like package and
system architecture policies, one has to make the incomprehnsibly (indeed)
difficult choice of choosing his network stack. Generally speaking, a decent
choice for estabilishing WiFi connection, is using &lt;code>iwd&lt;/code>. And &lt;code>dhcpcd&lt;/code> for ethernet.
In this article, I would be focusing on WiFi and DNS hardening. More specifically,
these are the areas where slight changes to the configuration would offer a more
secure network stack:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Practical Guide to GnuPG</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/a-practical-guide-to-gpg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:22:03 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/a-practical-guide-to-gpg/</guid><description>&lt;center>

&lt;p>Using GnuPG can be hard, we&amp;rsquo;ve been there before. You generate your keys and
then somehow you loose them, and then you realize you should get to learn how to
correctly use GnuPG, but reality hits and there are no complete tutorials. So
you go around the interent and try different articles and sources with no luck.
Although I don&amp;rsquo;t promise a complete and comprehensive guide to GnuPG, in this
article I would go over setting up GnuPG keys, subkeys, using GnuPG for SSH,
transferring keys to other computers and using online services like Github and
Codeberg.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hardening The Moto One Macro</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/hardening-the-one-macro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 06:56:35 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/hardening-the-one-macro/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Motorola One Macro is a mid-range phone, with decent &amp;ldquo;openness&amp;rdquo; which allows
basic hardening modification. The phone has the follow specifications:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mediatek MT6771 Helio P70 CPU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>720 x 1520 px, 19:9 ratios (~270 ppi)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Comes with Anroid 9.0, officially upgradable to Android 10.0&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mali-G72 MP3 GPU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eMMC 5.1 storage with 64GB&lt;/li>
&lt;li>microSDXC uses shared SIM slot, 32GB tested&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Main camera 13 MP, depth camera 2MP, 2MP for macro camera&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WIFI 802.11 b/g/n, with hotspot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No NFC support&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This guide goes over unlocking the bootloader, flashing a GSI, flashing
LineageOS, reflashing stock ROM, fixing bootloop problems, and news
on TWRP for the Moto One Macro.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>True Full Disk Encryption On Linux</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/true-full-disk-encryption/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 07:09:31 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/true-full-disk-encryption/</guid><description>&lt;p>My friends laugh at me when they are told that I have to put in 4 passwords
with ~18 characters each to login into my computer. I laugh back at them,
wishing them joy with Ads in the start-menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we will discuss &lt;em>true&lt;/em> full disk encryption. Everything,
including having the kernel encrypted using LUKS. I personally found difficulty
in finding good documentation detailing how to set-up disk encryption.
Hopefully this guide would help someone out there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
