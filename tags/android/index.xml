To be exact, this phone can be upgraded to phh&amp;rsquo;s treble Android 12 GSI. I have
already written a longer 


&lt;a href="https://ayham.xyz/posts/hardening-the-one-macro/"title="that article">guide&lt;/a> on this phone before, however it lacks some
edge cases. This guide would hopefully attempt to ammend these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I originally intended for that article to be a complete guide which works for
all Android versions. Although that is still somewhat true, I decided to rewrite
a standalone article for Android 12. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned some stuff about the phone,
some issues that could arise while updating, which I thought would deserve their
own guide. Now, this is an article attuned to the type of step-by-step, which
is a contrast to the original guide. This article could also hopefully act as a
step-by-step upgrade guide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hardening The Moto One Macro</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/hardening-the-one-macro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 06:56:35 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/hardening-the-one-macro/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Motorola One Macro is a mid-range phone, with decent &amp;ldquo;openness&amp;rdquo; which allows

&lt;p>This guide goes over unlocking the bootloader, flashing a GSI, flashing
LineageOS, reflashing stock ROM, fixing bootloop problems, and news
on TWRP for the Moto One Macro.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
