configured - through files. Using text for configuration might seem as a
step-back, however, GUI configurations were never a progression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having applications configured through text has a couple of advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Portable - any computer which can install that application can have the same
configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The light level of configuration - some Linux distributions, such as NixOS, offer
a system level configuration. However, this would invalidate the first point,
and the level of configuration would be potentially limited through the
configuration of the distribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>stow&lt;/code> method is minimal and re-uses packaging software for dotfiles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="your-dotfiles-in-git">Your dotfiles in Git&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to have portable dotfiles, you need a method of update &amp;amp; transport. For
that, you can use Git.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
