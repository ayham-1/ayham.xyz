The majority of Linux installs suffer from a major security threat, physical security. Any unencrypted drive's data can be easily stolen by attaching to a secondary device. This bypasses the user's password and leaves all data free for access. Unfortunately, to correctly configure a *complete* encrypted Linux system takes alot of patience and configuration. This script helps you manage GRUB automatically. All you have to do is install the system's `/` partition, plug the USB in and run the script. The script also supports booting from ISOs available on the dongle.
