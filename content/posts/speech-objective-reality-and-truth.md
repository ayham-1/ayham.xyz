Hello Everyone. 

The topic of objective reality versus relativism amuses me. It reminds me of
a characteristic development children go through from toddlers to adolescents;
is the attained ability of understanding that there exists beings outside of
itself that have different personalities and thoughts than the infant itself.
This relates to the relativists argument as, in its essence, in its maximal
state, it is the rule of me, myself and I. 

The relativist argument attempts to answer a very demanding question: "How do we
live our lives?"; unfortunately, its answer raises more issues than it solves.
Objective morality, becomes subjective. Concrete communities and human
interactions become non-existent. And political structures become tyrannies.

In terms of morality, the relativists' viewpoint is that there exists no right
or wrong but mine, there is no divine to guide us. All judgments become
self-centered and emotional. The implications of abolishing truth does not end
with "Live and Let Live"; abolishing truth means the abolishment of God, of the
divine. The German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche has an infamous quote, "God
is dead and we have killed him". Friedrich is said to be referring to The
Enlightenment philosophers, a more relevant interpretation is the comment on the
self-centric nature of relative truth. Relative Truth implies that humans are
capable of mustering perfect moral systems; that outside of our brains, there
exist nothing but us, and us is everything.

When it comes to communities and relationships between people, the existence of
those are inconceivable under the relativists point of view. How would
a relation with another person exist, if there is nothing outside my creation?
This trickles down into practical issues, the definitions of family, mother and
father are nothing without acknowledging an external bond between people. And on
a larger scale, expertise would no longer exist. By definition, an "expert" is
someone who has knowledge of the observable, but if there is nothing to observe,
knowledge would be nothing but a useless gimmick. Furthermore, the existence of
technology depends on two things; our ability to agree on things, and our
ability to prove that those things work in the real world. Both conditions can
not exist in relativist thinking without impossible mental gymnastics.

Of-course, any ideological answer to the question of "How To Live?", would have
political implications. It does not matter what a political system is,
democratic, republic or monarch, if that system does not synchronize itself with
reality, tyranny will prevail. From George Orwell's 1984 novel, "WAR IS PEACE,
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, AND IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH", there is no refute to these
statements without acknowledging a reality outside of yourself. You will not be
able to gauge policies. It is only then tyranny happens, when truth is
obstructed, hidden from the masses, when the fictitious reality created by the
narcissistic self is expanded to everyone it becomes hell.

To end my speech, I want to raise a logical problem. The statement, "Truth is
Subjective", or any of its iterations, for it to be taken seriously, there is
a need to explain why that statement "Truth is Subjective" should be considered
as a fact, a truth, if the implications of the statement defy its predicates.
How would you declare a statement that contradicts its own-self? Furthermore,
I would like to see my opposition answer this question: Why can I not declare
myself as a winner of this debate?

Thank You.
