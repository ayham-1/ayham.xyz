Motorola One Macro, codename lima, can surprisingly be upgraded to Android 12.
To be exact, this phone can be upgraded to phh's treble Android 12 GSI. I have
already written a longer guide on this phone beforehand, however it lacked some
edge cases of problems. This guide would hopefully attempt to ammend that list.
