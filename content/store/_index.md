firmus is a trusty, strong and reliable application launcher for Android.

The main distinctive feature of the firmus launcher is the 4-page homescreen: 
empty, history, search page and all apps. The pages are accessed by: clicking
on the screen to open history, clicking on the small circle to open all apps,
typing in the search bar opens the search page, clicking anywhere empty clears
the screens.

The settings page includes a minimal but comprehensive list of configurations
that can be toggled and changed dynamically in runtime: startup page choice,
disable history, prefer applications over contacts when searching, left/right
hand layout, use grid layout, setup background color (can be transparent), 
border color, search bar color.
