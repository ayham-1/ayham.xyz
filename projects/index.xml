Any unencrypted drive&amp;rsquo;s data can be easily stolen by attaching to a secondary device. This bypasses the user&amp;rsquo;s password and leaves all data free for access. Unfortunately, to correctly configure a &lt;em>complete&lt;/em> encrypted Linux system takes alot of patience and configuration. This script helps you manage GRUB automatically. All you have to do is install the system&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>/&lt;/code> partition, plug the USB in and run the script. The script also supports booting from ISOs available on the dongle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>firmus</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/projects/firmus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 09:20:47 +0200</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/projects/firmus/</guid><description>&lt;p>A trusty, strong and reliable application launcher for Android.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>fixmydownloads</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/projects/fixmydownloads/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 09:20:47 +0200</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/projects/fixmydownloads/</guid><description>&lt;p>The goal of the project is to make the simplest downloads folder organizer that is configured by code making it so small that the whole thing fits in one file!
